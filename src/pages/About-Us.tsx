      question: "What makes EuroVoyage different from other tour companies?",
      answer: "EuroVoyage stands out through our expert local guides, small group sizes (never more than 16 travelers), authentic cultural experiences, and commitment to sustainable tourism. We focus exclusively on European destinations, allowing us to offer deeper expertise and connections in every location we visit."
    },
    {
      question: "How large are your tour groups?",
      answer: "We believe in quality experiences over quantity. Our groups are intentionally kept small, with a maximum of 12-16 travelers depending on the tour. This ensures personalized attention, easier access to local sites, and more meaningful cultural interactions."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the tour price?",
      answer: "Our tour prices typically include accommodations, expert guides, transportation within the tour, entrance fees to scheduled attractions, and select meals as specified in each itinerary. International airfare, travel insurance, optional activities, and some meals are generally not included, allowing you flexibility in your travel arrangements."
    },
    {
      question: "How physically demanding are your tours?",
      answer: "We offer tours with varying activity levels, from leisurely to active. Each tour is clearly marked with an activity level rating and detailed information about walking distances, terrain, and other physical requirements. We're happy to help you find a tour that matches your comfort level."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
      answer: "We understand plans can change. For most tours, cancellations made 90+ days before departure receive a full refund minus deposit. Cancellations 60-89 days prior receive a 50% refund, and cancellations less than 60 days before departure are non-refundable. We strongly recommend travel insurance to protect your investment."
